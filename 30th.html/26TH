    <li> The roots of Republic Day trace back to India's struggle for independence from British rule.</li>
            <li> Following freedom on August 15, 1947, the nation operated under the Government of India Act, 1935, lacking a permanent constitution.</li>
             <li>Led by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, a dedicated drafting committee worked tirelessly, and on January 26, 1950, the Constitution of India was officially adopted.</li>
             <li> signifying a transformative moment as India became a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic.</li>
